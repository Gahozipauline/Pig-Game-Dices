# Description of the project
Pig is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points. To play you'll need 2 to 10 players, one 6-sided dice, and a pencil and some paper for keeping score 
# Project setup instruction
 You Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn. If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player. Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.
